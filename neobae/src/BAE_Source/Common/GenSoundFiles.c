**              I'm going to miss your irreverent humor. Your coding style and desire
**              to make things as fast as possible. Your collaboration behind this entire
**              codebase. Your absolute belief in creating the best possible relationships 
**              from honesty and integrity. Your ability to enjoy conversation. Your business 
**              savvy in understanding the big picture. Your gentleness. Your willingness 
**              to understand someone else's way of thinking. Your debates on the latest 
**              political issues. Your generosity. Your great mimicking of cartoon voices. 
**              Your friendship. - Steve Hales
**

**  8/5/99      Fixed bug in PV_WriteFromMemoryWaveFile() affecting
**              8 bit data on Motorola-byte-order platforms. Fixed bug in IFF_WriteSize in which data

**              to appease certain compilers (visual, CW Solaris)
**  10/28/99    MSD: Added PV_WriteFromMemorySunAUFile()
**  1/26/00     Changed PV_ReadIntoMemoryMPEGFile to close the mpeg stream after getting info
**              and setting variables up that are used for streaming.
**  2/4/2000    Changed copyright. We're Y2K compliant!
**  2/14/2000   Fixed an endian bug in PV_ReadSunAUFile()
**  2/17/2000   Put creation wrappers around GM_WriteFileFromMemory and its associated code.
**  4/5/2000    Removed warnings in PV_ReadIntoMemoryWaveFile & PV_ReadIntoMemorySunAUFile
**  2000.04.24 msd  Added GM_FinalizeFileHeader() to support writing output to file
**  2000.04.25 msd  added GM_ReadRawAudioIntoMemoryFromMemory() to support MiniBAE API lego.
**  2000.04.27 msd  Fixed problem of not closing AU file after saving.
**                  Added AU and AIFF support to writing output to file
**                  Encapsulated writing mixer slices to audio files in GM_WriteAudioBufferToFile()
**  2000.05.08 msd  Fixed problem in writing AIFF header in GM_FinalizeFileHeader()
**  8/28/2000   sh  Changed the way PV_ReadIntoMemoryAIFFFile gets loop points and base pitch. Now
**                  correctly follows the AIFF spec.
**  8/30/2000   sh  Fixed bug in IFF_GetAIFFMarkerValue that forgot to check for the number
**                  of markers.
**  12/13/2000  sh  Added GM_CreateFileState & GM_DisposeFileState so that we can stream data
**                  for AU files and preserve state between calls to GM_ReadAndDecodeFileStream.
**                  Changed PV_ReadSunAUFile & PV_UnpackInput to handle passed in state. Eliminated
**                  use of global variables.
**  12/29/2000  sh  Added IFF_WriteWAVLoopPoints, and modifed PV_WriteFromMemoryWaveFile to call 
**                  IFF_WriteWAVLoopPoints when writing out WAV data.
**                  Added IFF_WriteAIFFLoopPoints and modified PV_WriteFromMemoryAiffFile to call
**                  it.
**              sh  Fixed two problems with AIF and the - 8 issue. 1) Turns out we were writing
**                  an extra 8 bytes when writing out the X_SoundData chunk without increasing
**                  the size of the block written, so it was wrong in length. The extra 8 bytes
**                  are an offset and a alignment value. 2) we thinking wrongly about why we
**                  need to subtract 8 when writing out the total lenght. The 8 is that case
**                  is not the 8 for the samples, but for the FORM/TYPE header size.
**  1/3/2001    sh  Added GM_RepositionFileStream for support in repositioning a stream.
**  1/12/2001   sh  Modifed PV_ReadIntoMemorySunAUFile to set the GM_Waveform member waveFrames,
**                  correctly.
**  1/23/2001   sh  inital pass as position code
**  1/25/2001   sh  fixed decoding of AU files, it was skipping frames when the size
**                  of the decode was not the entire file.
**  1/26/2001   sh  Fixed a problem with uncompressed samples and GM_ReadAndDecodeFileStream.
**                  We were reading past the end of the file and responding to and error
**                  and ignoring the last buffer of data. This was for AIF, and WAV only.
**  2/2/2001    sh  Changed IFF_PutChunk & IFF_WriteBlock to return an OPErr. Just a type change.
**                  Changed IFF_WriteAIFFLoopPoints to pass through error codes.
**  3/19/2001   sh  Fixed a few warnings.
**  5/20/2001   sh  New structure packing stuff, and now compiling more code even when
**                  USE_HIGHLEVEL_FILE_API is FALSE
