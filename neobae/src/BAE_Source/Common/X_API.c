**  4/22/97     Fixed a bug with XGetPtrSize that referenced a NULL pointer
**
**  6/5/97      (Beatnik Editor Windows)
**              bvk - Changed the _creat call (in XFileOpenResource) to use the right 
**              flags based on this goofy Microsoft C++ 5.0 (_S_IREAD | _S_IWRITE 
**              instead of _O_RDWR).  Added an include (sys/stat.h).
**
**  6/12/97     bvk - Added XGetResourceNameOnly().  Copied/modified from other code.
**              Doesn't load the resource data, just checks resource headers.
**  6/13/97     bvk - Added XCountFileResourcesOfType(XFILE fileRef, long int theType);
**
**  6/19/97     bvk - Fixed bug in XAddFileResource.  Wasn't flipping the 'next' value,
**                  Fixed bug getting name in XGetResourceNameOnly().
**
**  6/22/97     bvk - Changed XGetPtrSize(XPTR data).  It used to innocently assume that
**                  it could get the handle for any data pointer to get the size.  That
**                  actually leaves a lot of room for error...
**
**  6/27/97     bvk - Added XDeleteFileResource.  This functions in two ways, either to delete
**                  the resource immediately, or to just mark it as a 'TRSH' resource.
**                  Then, trash collection occurs when XCleanResourceFile() is called.
**                  For either case, resource deletion fails if the file has been opened as
**                  read only.
**
**  7/02/97     bvk - Fixed bug in XGetResourceNameOnly().
**
**  7/03/97     bvk - Fixed bug in XCleanResourceFile() that was writing the # of resources wrong.
**
**  7/05/97     bvk - Modified the resource info caching system.  Read carefully:
**                  Originally, the resource cache was only created if the res
**                  file was opened ReadOnly.  Ostensibly, this was because the
**                  resource map cache would be out of date should a resource add
**                  or delete take place.
**
**                  Now, the cache is used for all types of files.  It is updated
**                  correctly should the res file have added or deleted resources.
**
**                  I also rewrote some frequently called routines to use the cache.
**
**                  I also disabled loading the pre-generated cache from the resource file.
**                  Too many of my files didn't have 'em (and none of these routines write it out!)
**
**  5/3/97      Fixed a few potential problems that the MOT compiler found
**  5/13/97     Fixed extra byte swap with XGetIndexedFileResource. Thanks Moe!
**  6/20/97     Changed XGetHardwareVolume & XSetHardwareVolume for MacOS
**              to support news names for CW 2.0
**  6/30/97     Fixed a bug in XCompressPtr that forgot the extra four bytes! Thanks Moe!
**  7/14/97     Put in special case to XFixedDivide to handle zero values better and faster.
**              Put in support for new X_PLATFORM type, called X_WIN_BAE
**  7/17/97     Removed XIsVirtualMemoryAvailable & XLockMemory & XUnlockMemory. Because
**              its assumed that all memory is locked.
**              Removed XSetHardwareSampleRate & XGetHardwareSampleRate
**  7/18/97     Added XFileSetLength
**  7/21/97     Changed XGetResourceName to call XGetResourceNameOnly.
**  7/30/97     Removed references to creat because its not ANSI, now using the ANSI way which
**              is to call open with O_CREAT flag.
**  8/13/97     Fixed bug in XDuplicateAndStripStr that didn't increment counter the right way
**  8/18/97     Changed X_WIN_BAE to USE_BAE_EXTERNAL_API
**  9/3/97      Wired XGetHardwareVolume & XSetHardwareVolume to BAE_EXTERNAL_API
**              Wrapped a few more functions around USE_CREATION_API
**  9/29/97     Changed XSetBit & XClearBit & XTestBit to be uint32_t rather than long
**  10/2/97     Fixed a bug with XGetFileResource when trying to load a memory based resource
**              it still continued searching after it found what it was looking for.
**              Fixed XGetIndexedFileResource to support memory based resource files without
**              duplicating memory
**  10/14/97    Fixed bug with XFileOpenForWrite that didn't allow creation of files.
**  10/18/97    Modified XDisposePtr to mark blocks deallocated
**  11/19/97    Modified XNewPtr to allocate memory for performance
**  12/16/97    Moe: removed compiler warnings
**  12/17/97    bvk - Modified PV_XGetNamedCacheEntry().  Here's the problem:
**              Memory resource files don't have caches.  So how does a function 
**              like XGetNamedResource(), that relies on PV_XGetNamedCacheEntry() 
**              work?  IT DOESN'T.
**              PV_XGetNamedCacheEntry() now will search the whole file if for the
**              named resource if it is a memory file!
**  12/18/97    bvk - Modified XGetAndDetachResource so that in the case of memory files,
**              it truly creates a new buffer (so that calls to dispose of the resource
**              don't fail/nuke the res file).
**  1/8/98      MOE: added XSwapLongsInAccessCache()
**  1/9/98      Added XFileDelete
**  1/21/98     Changed the functions XGetShort & XGetLong & XPutShort & XPutLong
**              into macros that fall out for Motorola order hardware
**  1/26/98     Added int32_t to various functions
**  1/31/98     Moved XPI_Memblock structures to X_API.h, and moved the function
**              XIsOurMemoryPtr to X_API.h
**  2/7/98      Changed XFIXED back to an uint32_t to fix broken content
**  2/9/98      Fixed bug with memory files and XFileClose in which the memory
**              block allocated outside of the resource file system was deallocated!
**  3/18/98     Added XIs8BitSupported
**  3/23/98     MOE: Changed _XGetShort() and _XGetLong() to accept const* pointers
**  3/23/98     MOE: Added _XGetShortIntel() and _XGetLongIntel()
**  3/23/98     MOE: Fixed big memory leak in XCompressPtr()
**  4/15/98     Removed the conditional compile for XGet/XPutXXX functions
**  4/20/98     Fixed a bug with XGetIndexedFileResource that return the wrong resource length
**              Fixed a alignment bug with Solaris only that caused memory to not be freed in
**              XIsOurMemoryPtr and XNewPtr. Did this by changing the size of the XPI_Memblock
**              structure to 16 bytes rather than 12.
**  4/27/98     Changed XCompressPtr to handle XCOMPRESSION_TYPE
**  4/27/98     MOE:  Changed XDecompressPtr() and XCompressPtr(),
**              eliminated XDecompressSampleFormatPtr()
**  5/7/98      Added XGetTempXFILENAME
**  5/12/98     Added some missing MacOS header files
**
**  6/5/98      Jim Nitchals RIP    1/15/62 - 6/5/98
**              I'm going to miss your irreverent humor. Your coding style and desire
**              to make things as fast as possible. Your collaboration behind this entire
**              codebase. Your absolute belief in creating the best possible relationships 
**              from honesty and integrity. Your ability to enjoy conversation. Your business 
**              savvy in understanding the big picture. Your gentleness. Your willingness 
**              to understand someone else's way of thinking. Your debates on the latest 
**              political issues. Your generosity. Your great mimicking of cartoon voices. 
**              Your friendship. - Steve Hales
**

**              deallocated twice

**              the XFILENAME if there was a problem
**  9/10/98     Put XGetFileAsData into the common build code because BAE.cpp uses it,
**              and the new exporter API uses it.
**              Fixed XGetIndexedType & XCountTypes to handle a NULL file reference being passed
**              in meaning use from most recently opened file.
**  9/30/98     Added test to XNewPtr to fail if size passed in is zero.
**  11/11/98    Cleaned up some left over bark in XGetAndDetachResource. Renamed pName to pResourceName
**              because of a MacOS macro conflict.
**              Added XReadPartialFileResource
**              Removed unused macros XGet/Put and placed them back into
**              real functions
**  11/18/98    Fixed a bug with XFileClose in which a file that was closed
**              twice would crash rather than get ignored.
**  12/21/98    Fixed a memory leak in XCleanResourceFile
**  12/22/98    Added USE_FILE_CACHE to control cache usage
**              Modified XCleanResourceFile to delete the cache resource if there is one, because
**              it can become invalid after a clean or delete. Also modified XAddFileResource to
**              delete the file cache
**  1/5/98      Fixed a warning in XFileClose and changed copyrights

**  5/26/99     MOE:  Added XResizePtr()
**  5/26/99     MOE:  Made XStrLen() more efficient and straightforward
**  5/28/99     MOE:  Changed XStrLen() & XEncryptedStrLen() to return long,
**              and accept const pointers
**  5/28/99     MOE:  Changed the string/memory manipulation functions
**              to accept const pointers
**  6/8/99      Removed references to USE_BAE_EXTERNAL_API. We now require BAE_API
**  7/13/99     Renamed HAE to BAE. Renamed BAEAudioMixer to BAEAudioOutput. Renamed BAEMidiDirect
**              to BAEMidiSynth. Renamed BAEMidiFile to BAEMidiSong. Renamed BAERMFFile to BAERmfSong.

**  8/10/99     Changed XFileSetPositionRelative & XFileSetLength to return an int32_t
**  8/11/99     MOE: Changed XAddFileResource() to fix two problems:
**                  writing name was failing but XFileWrite()'s return value was ignored
**                  cacheItem.fileOffsetData was not being set right
**                      (this problem was masked by the fact that the built cache was never used)
**  8/11/99     MOE: Added XCtoPascalString()
**  8/11/99     MOE: Made XCtoPstr() safely handle strings longer than 255 characters
**  8/11/99     MOE:  Added XLongToStr()
**  8/17/99     Fixed bug in XDeleteFileResource in which if a cache is used and the resource is
**              not in the cache, it now will search the file and delete it.
**  8/19/99     Fixed XCleanResourceFile to not ignore an error returned from changing the length of
**              a file. Also fixed XDeleteFileResource to not ignore the error returned from calling
**              XCleanResourceFile.
**  8/28/99     Renamed resourceFileCount & openResourceFiles to g_resourceFileCount & g_openResourceFiles
**              to emphisize their global nature. This is not thread safe. If you need thread safe
**              resource access, only access the resource API's that you pass in an XFILE.
**              This is going to change.
**              Increased MAX_OPEN_XFILES to 10 open files at once. Removed obsolete macro USE_WIN32_FILE_IO.
**  9/1/99      Changed PV_CopyWithinFile to return an int32_t rather than a int.
**  9/8/99      MOE: Changed XResizePtr() to check for same-size reallocation
**  9/8/99      MOE: Changed XResizePtr() to not always attempt to reallocate large blocks
**              This is a hack to be taken out when BAE_ResizePointer() exists
**  9/8/99      MOE: Added XGetFileResourceName(),
**              XExistsResource(), XExistsFileResource(),
**              XMakeUniqueResourceID(), XMakeUniqueFileResourceID()
**              Changed XGetResourceName() to return whether it found a resource,
**              and changed it so that searching would stop if it finds a
**              resource with a NULL name.  (It had been falling through to
**              match a resource in a lower-level resource file if the higher
**              level resource had a NULL name.)
**  10/7/99     Fixed bugs in XGetResourceName in which pascal strings were not being
**              converted to C strings prior to returning. Also failed to handle
**              the Mac native resource case
**  10/9/99     Modified PV_AddResourceFileToOpenFiles & PV_RemoveResourceFileFromOpenFiles
**              to fail if called from different threads
**              Fixed bug in XFileOpenResource in which an attempt to open a resource left it
**              open and in the search change even though it failed the validation test
**              Fixed XGetResourceNameOnly to search through Mac resources if non found in XFILE
**              resources
**  10/20/99    MSD: moved X_PLATFORM dependent #includes to BAEBuildOptions_*.h
**  12/13/99    Modified XFileClose to call XFileFreeResourceCache to clear the RAM based cached.
**              Fixed bug in XAddFileResource in which the RAM based cache that is maintained when
**              adding new resources with PV_AddToAccessCache was not storing into the structure
**              in the native endian mode, so cache entries would become invalid unless you closed
**              the file and reopened it.
**  1/21/00     Fixed a few cast issues with XFILE and MacOS.
**              MSD: added XConvertPathToXFILENAME()
**  1/25/00     Modified XConvertPathToXFILENAME to not convert a path if its larger than 255
**              bytes. Pascal string limit for MacOS
**  2/4/2000    Changed copyright. We're Y2K compliant!
**  3/14/2000   Fixed XGetNamedResource to search through the file for a named resource
**              if the file cache system is not enabled.
**  3/15/2000   Fixed XGetNamedResource to work correctly under MacOS.
**  3/29/2000   jsc: XFileOpenResource was leaving file open on failure.
**  4/14/2000   jsc: moved MAX_OPEN_XFILES to X_API.h and increased from 10 to 100
**  5/2/2000    sh: Added XFileIsValidResourceFromName & XFileIsValidResource
**  7/07/2000   DS: Created Mutex "object" for future use -- currently ifdef'd out.
**  2000.07.14 AER  Due to collisions between XBankTokens discovered in the
**                  field, I've made XBankToken a struct with some added data.
**                  It should collide less now (although without a better
**                  GUID-style system, there's still the potential)
**                  Added functions to more easily create and read them
**  7/25/2000   sh  Removed PV_IsVirtualMemoryAvailable. It was MacOS specific
**                  and not used here anymore.
**  10/1/2000   sh  Changed XConvertPathToXFILENAME to call the internal c to
**                  pascal string function. Conflicts with MacOS X Carbon.
**  12/21/2000  sh  Forced a setting in XFileOpenResourceFromMemory. There's a bug
**                  when passing FALSE to allowMemCopy into this function. NOT FIXED.
**                  Needs to be looked into.
**  1/24/2002   sh  Removed XGetHardwareVolume/XSetHardwareVolume, they were
**                  duplicated by BAE_GetHardwareVolume/BAE_SetHardwareVolume
**                  Fixed declaration of XDuplicateMemory
**  5/2/2001    sh  Added cool Mac trick to XConvertPathToXFILENAME to convert unix/dos
**                  paths to Mac FSSpec. Also handles relative paths.
**  5/29/2001   sh  Added new debugging system with debug_message
**  7-16-2001   dcm Added uint32_t XSwapShortInLong(uint32_t value) to swap shorts in long
**  8/28/2001       Fixed massive memory leak in XGetAndDetachResource when using memory files.
**                  Was duplicating resource when it was not required.
**  1/24/2002   sh  Removed XGetHardwareVolume/XSetHardwareVolume, they were
**                  duplicated by BAE_GetHardwareVolume/BAE_SetHardwareVolume
**                  Fixed declaration of XDuplicateMemory
